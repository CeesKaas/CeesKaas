# Ideas

## Automated Rule Checker during build
### Concept
During automated builds you may want to verify if all processes are followed.
for example:
* was a unittest added on a bugfix branch
* are there packages available for upgrade
* is unittest coverage high enough

must be possible to add approved overrides for example in signed JWT format
